        <h3>Yoga</h3>

        <h3>Boxing</h3>
        <p>
          If the Rocky movie series taught us anything (and it taught us a lot),

          including at home.

        <h3>Cycling</h3>
        <p>
          If running is a bit too high-impact for your joints, but you still
          enjoy getting out and about, cycling can be a great alternative.

        <h3>Chess</h3>
        <p>
          The Game of Kings can seem like a tricky one to get started with.
          However, once you’ve mastered the basic rules, chess is a hobby that
          can provide hours of entertainment (and frustration).

        <p>
          For those looking for a more general view of coding, you’re also in

          sought-after.

        <h3>Puzzles</h3>
        <p>
          Puzzles are a great hobby to get into for many reasons. Not only are
          they brain-teasingly satisfying, but they also help improve your
          memory and problem-solving skills.
